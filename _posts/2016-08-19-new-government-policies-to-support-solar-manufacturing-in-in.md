  India's solar cell and module manufacturing capacity was about 1,200MW and
  5,600MW respectively according to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)
  figures as of April 2016. These numbers appear significant in relation to
  annual addition in solar power generation capacity, however, the average size
